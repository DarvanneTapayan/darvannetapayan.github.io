# Welcome to My GitHub Repository

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm passionate about web development and Python programming. This repository serves as a showcase of my work, projects, and contributions in these areas.

# Welcome to My GitHub Repository

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a Python enthusiast who's just starting out on my programming journey. In this repository, you'll find some of my early Python projects and code snippets as I learn and grow.

## About Me

I'm a beginner in the world of programming, with a focus on Python. So far, I've learned the basics, including:

- **Functions (def):** I can define and call functions in Python.
- **Conditional Statements (if, else):** I use these to make decisions in my code.
- **Loops (while and for):** I'm starting to grasp the concept of loops for repetition and iteration.

## Projects

Here are some of the simple projects and code examples you can find in this repository:

1. **Hello World:**
   - [Hello World](/hello-world.py): My first Python program, the classic "Hello, World!".

2. **Simple Calculator:**
   - [Calculator](/simple-calculator.py): A basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **Number Guessing Game:**
   - [Number Guessing Game](/number-guessing-game.py): A simple game where you guess a randomly generated number.

4. **Basic Python Code Snippets:**
   - [Code Snippets](/code-snippets/): A collection of simple Python code snippets showcasing my learning progress.
